# Simple jQuery Alpha Numeric Inputs

##### Extremely simple and easy way to add `alpha`, `numeric`, and `alphanumeric` inputs to any page.

---

Simply give any input 1 of the three following classes and watch the magic!
 - **alpha**
 - **numeric**
 - **alphanumeric**

---

If you'd like to allow a few other chars, such as "$" or "&", then simply include them in a data attribute named "allow", like so:
 
    <input class="alpha" data-allow="$#*" type="text" />
